Engine specifics:
GameObjects and Components:
In this engine, everything in the game are objects and are represented as GameObjects.
To make these GameObjects alive in the game, we use components.
Components are like specialized functions that give these game elements unique abilities.


The engine has other features, including:
-AudioService -> This helps the game play sounds, like music or special effects
It can do loading, playing music, playing sound and it can mute all sounds.

-Inputmanager + Commands -> used to bind actions to keys/Controllers
when playing single -> Player can play with keyboard and controller.
when playing coop/versus -> the first controller is binded to the second player and the second controller to the first player.

-Observers - can add subjects to the observer to change hp and points -> not implemented.
but changing points and hp changing does work.
